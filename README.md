A beta showcasing the basic gameplay is available for Windows and Linux. You can download it from the Releases section of the repository.

## How to play:

The playfield is a hexagonal ring of hexagonal rings. You control the small black hexagon, which can move along both the inner and outer rings. Attacks will flash to the beat of the music -- first some warning flashes to indicate where they will strike, then one or more striking flashes that kill you if you're standing on the spot that they appear at. Try to survive as long as you can! The game displays your current score and your high score in the center of the screen.

Controls:
- A: move counterclockwise along inner ring
- D: move clockwise along inner ring
- J: move counterclockwise along outer ring
- L: move clockwise along outer ring
- Space: (re)start play
- Backspace: terminate play

Tips:
- Attacks vary on how they use flashing. Some have one flashing pattern that warns 3 or 7 times before striking; others have 3 or 6 flashing patterns that warn in succession, then strike in succession.
- Attack strikes are only deadly on the very first frame they appear.
- If you wait a bit after you die to an attack, the game will demonstrate it for you again.

## Development

Coding-wise, the main aspects of gameplay are complete, but level selection and settings still need to be added. Outside of coding, the game's three levels still need to be designed, and the music still needs to be created.
