A beta showcasing the basic gameplay is available for Windows and Linux. You can download it from the Releases section of the repository.

## How to play:

Controls:
- A, D, J, L: movement
- Space: (re)start play
- Backspace: terminate play

Tips:
- Attack flashes are only deadly on the very first frame they come out.
- If you wait a bit after you die to an attack, the game will demonstrate it for you again.

## Development

Coding-wise, the main aspects of gameplay are complete, but level selection and settings still need to be added. Outside of coding, the game's three levels still need to be designed, and the music needs to be created.
